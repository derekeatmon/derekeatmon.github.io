<p>My name is Derek Eatmon.  I was in the United States Army form 2006-2013.  I was given retirement and medical discharged after getting injured in Afghanistan and a few 
surgeries later.  I then started to work for the Department of Defense as a Systems Architect for three years on contract then that contract ended.  I wanted to work for
 myself so I decided to get licensed in Life and Health insurance.  While all of this is going on, I was in school and finally graduated in with a bachelors degree in Animation 
Technology.  

In the military, I worked as a signal support systems tech and worked on things from radios, crypto, satellite, and networking.  I have limited knowlege in coding and want to know
a lot more so I can be a success in that field.   </p>
